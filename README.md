## PROJECT 1: MyLangchain, ChatGPT Clone June 2023
- I developed a ChatGPT-like chat bot with ability to upload documents for query by the chatbot.
- Built with Next.JS 13 (full-stack) and Langchain, a library for rapidly developing AI web applications, and with Pinecone, a vector database.

## PROJECT 2: Hack Singapore 2023 (Angel Hack) - May 2023

## PROJECT 3: Capstone Project - Super LMS
- For my capstone project, I built an E-Learning marketplace application (Udemy clone) on the Refine(React) dashboard framework frontend, S3 file uploads + Express/Mongodb on the backend. Every company needs to implement its own in-house training system. Instructors can upload and arrange their learning material in the form of videos. Users can subscribe or purchase videos and chat with OpenAI. It was challenging and very satisfying.

## PROJECT 5: Trello-clone Project Task Management App
- This was a Kanban board planning tool app built with EJS and Express.JS, eveything on the backend. Able to upload files to AWS S3. Why? Because Kanban board are great tools for a project team. I wanted to see if I could build some of that functionality.
